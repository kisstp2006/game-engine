# NEXO Engine

Welcome to the NEXO Engine repository! This project is a collaborative effort to create a revolutionnary game engine. Our goal is to provide a robust, user-friendly, and efficient platform for game development in desktop as well as in virtual reality!

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in development and is not yet ready for production use. Some features may change.

## External Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following:
- **CMake**: Necessary for building the project from source.
- **C++ Compiler**: We recommend using GCC or Clang for Linux and MacOS, and MSVC for Windows.

## Build the project

Cloning and building is a breeze:

### 1. Clone the repository with the submodules.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules
```

### 2. Run cmake to generate the build files.

#### Using cmake presets (automatic)

```bash
cmake --workflow --present=build-debug
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are several presets available: `build-debug`, `build-release`, `build-coverage`, `minimal-build`, `test-debug`, and `test-coverage`.

#### Using cmake --build (manual)

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

### 3. Launch the engine!

#### For Linux and MacOS:
```bash
./build/nexoEditor
```

#### For Windows:
```bash
./build/nexoEditor.exe
```

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed instructions, visit our [Installation Guide](docs/install/README.md).

## Install the project

### Install via CMake

First build the project as seen in the step [Build the project](#build-the-project).
Then run the following command:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install
```

This will install the NEXO Engine in the directory `/path/to/install` with all the necessary files.

### Create an installer for Windows (NSIS)

To create an installer for Windows, you can use the [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) installer.

> [!WARNING]
> We assume here that you already ran the cmake command to generate the build files in the `build` directory.

First install NSIS on your computer, then run the following command:

```bash
cd build
cpack -G NSIS -C Debug
```

Now you can run the generated installer to install the NEXO Engine on your computer.

## Create an installer for Linux (DEB)

> [!WARNING]
> We assume here that you already ran the cmake command to generate the build files in the `build` directory.

```bash
cd build
cpack -G DEB
```

To install the generated package (on Ubuntu/Debian...), run the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i NEXO-Engine-*-Linux.deb
```

## Run the tests

In this project tests use the [gtest](http://google.github.io/googletest/) library.

First build the tests:
```bash
cmake -B build -DNEXO_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
```

Then run the tests:
```bash
cd build
ctest -C Debug
```

We thank Epitech for the opportunity to work on such an engaging project and for the support throughout our educational journey.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
For more information about the copyright of the project, please refer to the [COPYRIGHT](COPYRIGHT) file, 
you can also find the license of the third-party libraries used in the project in the [external/licenses](external/licenses) directory.

### How to extract the third-party licenses file

You can use the cmake install command:
```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install --component generate-licenses
```

This will extract all licenses per third-party library in the `/path/to/install/external/licenses` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> These licenses are automatically extracted from vcpkg, there might be missing third-party libraries.

### How to generate the COPYRIGHT file

You can use the cmake install command:
```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install --component generate-copyright
```

This will generate the COPYRIGHT file in the `/path/to/install` directory.

> [!WARNING]
> By default the COPYRIGHT file is generated with some `TODO:`, the generator cannot always determine exact licenses for some files. Please check each entry for errors.
